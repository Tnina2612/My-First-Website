# My First Website

This project is a practice exercise for publishing a website using GitHub Pages. It serves as my introduction to HTML, where I explore and experiment with the fundamental concepts of web development.

The main goals of this project include:

- Gaining hands-on experience with basic HTML elements and structure

- Learning how to host a static website using GitHub Pages

- Understanding the workflow of version control and deployment with Git

This site represents the first step in my web development journey.
